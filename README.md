There are three folders Java, C++ and Python each has codes written in that language. You can open this folder and check the corresponding readme for more vivid detail about the project.

You need to have a basic knowledge of C++, Java and Python to start working on these algorithm or for understanding them. If you are okay with this than please use git clone to download and start working on this repository.

Steps to compile and run different languages :-

1. How to compile `Java` on Ubuntu `javac <file_name.java>`
